            Meet Franky! This robust and lively fellow has a muscular build and a personality as flashy as his custom-made 
            collar with embedded lights. Franky is always ready for action, whether it’s showing off his mechanical tail 
            that wags on command or leading the pack in a game of fetch. With his loud, boisterous barks and confident strut,
             Franky is sure to bring excitement and creativity to any home lucky enough to adopt him.

            knows no bounds, and he’s always on the lookout for the next big adventure. If you’re searching for a dog who

          <img src="../dog-party-assets/dog4-sq.jpg" alt="Dog 4"/>
          <p>
            Say hello to Nico Robin, a pup with a sleek, silky coat and a calm, observant nature. Robin is a bit more 
            reserved than other dogs, preferring the quiet company of those she trusts over boisterous play. She has a 
            keen eye for detail and understands the unspoken dynamics of any situation, making her a thoughtful and wise 
            companion. With her graceful movements and piercing gaze, Robin embodies a sense of mystery and intelligence that 
            sets her apart. For those looking for a unique and loyal friend, Nico Robin is the perfect choice.
